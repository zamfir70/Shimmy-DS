/// ðŸ”§ PHASE 1: Obligation Injection Hook
///
/// Allows shimmy-DS to prepend current unresolved obligations to the prompt

/// into user prompts to ensure story continuity and narrative coherence.
/// Now enhanced with ObliSelect smart obligation management for intelligent selection.

///
/// # Returns
/// A new string with obligations prepended to the original prompt
///
/// # Example
/// ```

///
/// let prompt = "What happens next?";
