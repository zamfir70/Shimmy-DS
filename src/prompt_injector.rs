/// ðŸ”§ PHASE 1: Obligation Injection Hook
///
/// Allows shimmy-DS to prepend current unresolved obligations to the prompt
/// before sending to the model.
///
/// This module provides the core functionality for injecting narrative obligations
/// into user prompts to ensure story continuity and narrative coherence.

/// Injects obligations into a prompt by prepending each obligation as a statement.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `prompt` - The original user prompt
/// * `obligations` - A slice of obligation strings to inject
///
/// # Returns
/// A new string with obligations prepended to the original prompt
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// use shimmy_ds::prompt_injector::inject_obligations;
///
/// let prompt = "What happens next?";
/// let obligations = vec!["Harper was last seen in the attic".to_string()];
/// let injected = inject_obligations(prompt, &obligations);
///
/// assert!(injected.starts_with("Obligation: Harper was last seen in the attic."));
/// assert!(injected.ends_with("What happens next?"));
/// ```

/// Stub function to load obligations from persistent state.
///
/// In a full implementation, this would read from a file, database, or other
/// persistent storage mechanism to retrieve the current list of unresolved
/// narrative obligations.

/// # Returns
/// A vector of obligation strings
