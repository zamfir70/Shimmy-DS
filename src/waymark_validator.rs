/// ðŸ§­ PHASE 2: Spatial Continuity Validator (WAYMARK Integration)
///
/// Checks if current prompt violates last known location.
/// This module provides functionality to validate location transitions
/// in narrative generation to ensure spatial continuity.

/// Validates whether generated output contains appropriate location transition indicators
/// when transitioning from a known last location.
///
/// This function checks if the generated text contains movement indicators that properly
/// acknowledge the character's departure from their last known location.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `output` - The generated text to validate
/// * `last_location` - The character's last known location
///
/// # Returns
/// `true` if the output contains valid location transition indicators, `false` otherwise
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// use shimmy_ds::waymark_validator::validate_location_transition;
///
/// let output = "Harper left the attic and walked downstairs";
/// let last_location = "attic";
/// let is_valid = validate_location_transition(output, last_location);
/// assert!(is_valid);
///
/// let invalid_output = "Harper was suddenly in the kitchen";
/// let is_invalid = validate_location_transition(invalid_output, last_location);
/// assert!(!is_invalid);
/// ```
