RIP+RIC UNIFIED PROTOCOL STACK ARCHITECTURE
==========================================

ðŸ§¬ PROTOCOL OVERVIEW
The RIP+RIC Unified Protocol Stack implements the world's first cross-language
narrative integrity system through 9 layered components working in harmony:

**RIP (Recursive Integrity Protocol) - Python Components:**
1. **Constraint Genome & Ligand System** (recursive_expander.py)
   - Ligand-based expansion anchoring from seed & beat obligations
   - 4-layer guard chain validation: Entity Scope, Proof Anchor, Emotional Vector, Surface-Depth Congruence
   - Dynamic constraint extraction and strength assessment
   - Narrative genome health scoring and validation

2. **Pathogen Detection Library** (drift_detector.py)
   - 6 pathogen types: Voice Drift, Personality Inversion, Motivation Drift, Arc Regression, Relationship Violation, Temporal Inconsistency
   - Fingerprint-based pattern matching for narrative contamination
   - Threat level assessment and voting integration
   - Real-time drift monitoring and alert generation

3. **ZC Gates & Loop Saturation Control** (recursive_growth_pass.py)
   - 5 gate types: Surface Expansion, Deep Analysis, Character Development, Thematic Exploration, Obligation Resolution
   - Budget-based recursion management with insight-triggered resets
   - Growth phase saturation detection and stagnation prevention
   - Quality-based expansion selection and optimization

**RIC (Recursive Integrity Core) - Rust Components:**
4. **Subsystem Consensus Engine** (recursive_integrity_core.rs)
   - Multi-subsystem voting with weighted arbitration
   - Saturation tracking across DNA, constraint, recursion, character, and engagement trackers
   - CAPR clamp return limiting and transformation detection
   - Continuity floor injection for emergency narrative completion

5. **Character Fusion System** (character_consistency.rs + RIP integration)
   - Cross-system pathogen detection for character inconsistencies
   - Constraint genome validation for character actions and dialogue
   - Unified RIP+RIC voting for character state assessment
   - Real-time character health monitoring and violation tracking

6. **Unified Arbitration Engine** (recursive_narrative_assistant.rs)

   - Priority-based decision making: Pathogen Detection â†’ Loop Saturation â†’ RIP Constraints â†’ RIC Consensus
   - Fail-closed protection with sovereignty preservation
   - Unified continuity floor coordination across both systems

7. **Enhanced Stability Logging** (stability_log.rs)
   - Comprehensive RIP+RIC fusion decision logging
   - Cross-system health metrics and trend analysis
   - Unified protocol performance monitoring
   - Decision audit trails with detailed breakdown for complex scenarios

**Cross-System Integration:**
8. **Python-Rust Bridge** (scripts/rip_bridge.py)

   - Cross-system pattern correlation and analysis

INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE
========================

Unified System Coordination:
```rust
pub struct RecursiveNarrativeAssistant {
    pub dna_tracker: NarrativeDNATracker,           // CAPR loops

    pub config: AssistantConfig,                       // Configuration
}
```
