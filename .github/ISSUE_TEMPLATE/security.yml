        # ⚠️ STOP - Do NOT report security issues here!
        
        **Security vulnerabilities should NOT be reported via public GitHub issues.**
        
        ## 🔒 Report Security Issues Privately
        
        Please use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:
        
        **👉 [Report Security Vulnerability](https://github.com/Michael-A-Kuykendall/shimmy/security/advisories/new)**
        
        ## 📧 Alternative Contact
        
        If you cannot use the private reporting feature, email us directly:
        **security@shimmy-ai.dev**
        
        ## 🛡️ Why Private Reporting?
        
        - Protects users while we develop a fix
        - Follows responsible disclosure practices
        - Allows us to coordinate patches safely
        - Prevents exploitation of the vulnerability
        
        ## 🚨 If You Posted Here by Mistake
        
        1. **Delete this issue immediately**
        2. Use the private reporting link above instead
        3. Do not include vulnerability details in public
        
        Thank you for helping keep Shimmy secure! 🙏
