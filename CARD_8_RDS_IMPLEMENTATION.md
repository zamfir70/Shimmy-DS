# 🧠 Card 8: Recursive Drift Stabilizer (RDS) - Implementation Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented Card 8: Recursive Drift Stabilizer (RDS) - a meta-stability layer that monitors and prevents slow narrative drift across recursive chapter generations. This system watches the long tail of recursion and warns when structural decay begins.

## ✅ Implementation Components

### 🏗️ Core System: `src/recursive_drift_stabilizer.rs`

**DriftStabilityState Struct:**
```rust
pub struct DriftStabilityState {
    pub unresolved_obligation_count: usize,
    pub stale_obligations: usize,
    pub emotional_decay_sum: f32,
    pub theme_drift_score: f32,
    pub spatial_return_pressure_lost: bool,
    pub current_chapter: u32,
    pub last_updated: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub metadata: HashMap<String, f32>,
}
```

**Key Functions Implemented:**
- ✅ `check_recursive_drift()` - Core drift detection with configurable thresholds
- ✅ `generate_drift_injection_prompt()` - Creates corrective prompts for detected drift
- ✅ `analyze_drift_trends()` - Historical trend analysis with confidence scoring
- ✅ `generate_drift_stability_report()` - Comprehensive reporting system

**Advanced Features:**
- ✅ Custom metadata tracking for character consistency, pacing, etc.
- ✅ Trend analysis with linear regression for drift prediction
- ✅ Configurable thresholds for different drift types
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (25+ tests)

### 📊 Advanced Reporting: `src/stability_log.rs`

**StabilityLogger System:**
- ✅ Dual logging (text + JSON) for stability events
- ✅ Memory caching for recent entries
- ✅ Trend analysis across chapters
- ✅ Chapter-by-chapter breakdown reports
- ✅ Global logger pattern for easy access

**Key Capabilities:**
- ✅ `generate_trend_analysis()` - Multi-chapter stability trends
- ✅ `generate_chapter_analysis()` - Detailed chapter breakdowns
- ✅ Real-time stability monitoring with configurable memory limits

### ⚙️ Configuration Integration

**shimmy-ds.toml Extensions:**
```toml
[drift_stabilizer]
enabled = true
stale_obligation_threshold = 5
emotional_decay_limit = 2.5
theme_threshold = 1.0
spatial_pressure_chapter_limit = 3
enable_drift_injection = true
enable_stability_logging = true
```

**Config Manager Updates:**
- ✅ `DriftStabilizerConfig` struct with full TOML support
- ✅ Runtime accessors: `is_drift_stabilizer_enabled()`, `get_stale_obligation_threshold()`, etc.
- ✅ Configuration status reporting integration
- ✅ Feature toggle support

## 🎯 Integration Points

### Main.rs Generate Command Integration

The Recursive Drift Stabilizer is fully integrated into the generation pipeline:

1. **Post-Generation Analysis** - Runs after model output
2. **Metrics Collection** - Gathers obligation, emotion, and theme data
3. **Drift Detection** - Checks against configurable thresholds
4. **Warning System** - Alerts user to detected drift patterns
5. **Corrective Guidance** - Suggests specific actions to address drift
6. **Comprehensive Logging** - Records all stability events

### Example Runtime Behavior

```bash
./shimmy generate phi3-lora --prompt "What happens next?" --max-tokens 100

# System now performs complete analysis:
# 1. Normal SHIMMY-DS augmentation
# 2. Generate content
# 3. Validate spatial continuity
# 4. Check recursive drift:

🧠 Recursive Drift Detected:
  ⚠️ Multiple unresolved obligations (6) remain unaddressed across recent chapters.
  ⚠️ Emotional field decay detected — resolution pressure falling (decay: 3.20).

📝 Suggested Drift Correction Prompt:
🧠 Narrative Drift Warning:
⚠️ Multiple unresolved obligations (6) remain unaddressed across recent chapters.
⚠️ Emotional field decay detected — resolution pressure falling (decay: 3.20).
→ Consider resolving or advancing at least one major obligation
→ Consider intensifying emotional stakes or providing resolution

Current Chapter: 1
Please address these drift concerns in the upcoming narrative.
```

## 🔍 Drift Detection Capabilities

### 1. **Obligation Drift**
- Tracks unresolved obligations across chapters
- Identifies stale obligations (unaddressed for 3+ chapters)
- Configurable threshold (default: 5 stale obligations)

### 2. **Emotional Decay**
- Monitors emotional intensity degradation over time
- Special weighting for negative emotions requiring resolution (guilt, sadness, fear, anger)
- Configurable decay limit (default: 2.5)

### 3. **Theme Coherence**
- Measures drift from original narrative themes
- Theme coherence scoring (0.0-1.0, higher is better)
- Configurable drift threshold (default: 1.0)

### 4. **Spatial Return Pressure**
- Detects when important locations haven't been revisited
- Tracks "gravity-decay" for high-importance locations
- Configurable chapter limits

### 5. **Custom Metadata Tracking**
- Character consistency scoring
- Pacing consistency monitoring
- Extensible system for domain-specific metrics

## 📈 Advanced Analytics

### Trend Analysis
- Linear regression on drift metrics
- Confidence scoring for trend predictions
- Multi-chapter lookback analysis
- Predictive drift warnings

### Historical Reporting
- Chapter-by-chapter drift breakdown
- Stability score calculation (0.0-1.0)
- Warning and injection rate tracking
- Performance metrics across narrative sessions

## 🎛️ Configuration Options

### Runtime Controls
```toml
[drift_stabilizer]
enabled = true                    # Master on/off switch
stale_obligation_threshold = 5    # When to warn about stale obligations
emotional_decay_limit = 2.5       # Emotional decay warning threshold
theme_threshold = 1.0             # Theme drift warning threshold
spatial_pressure_chapter_limit = 3 # Spatial pressure timeout
enable_drift_injection = true     # Show corrective prompts
enable_stability_logging = true   # Detailed logging
```

### Thresholds Explanation
- **Stale Obligations**: Number of obligations unaddressed for 3+ chapters
- **Emotional Decay**: Sum of emotional decay across tracked states
- **Theme Drift**: Deviation from original narrative coherence (0.0-3.0 scale)
- **Spatial Pressure**: Chapters since important location revisit

## 📋 Logging Outputs
