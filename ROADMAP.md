# Shimmy Roadmap ðŸš€

**Vision:** The privacy-first local AI infrastructure that replaces cloud dependencies

Shimmy is a 5MB, zero-config, OpenAI-compatible inference server targeting the **$50B+ AI inference market**. Its mission is **invisible infrastructure**: drop it in, it works.

## ðŸ†“ Forever Free Commitment

**Shimmy Core will always remain completely free and open-source.** This is not a "free tier" or "community edition" - it's a permanent commitment to the developer community.

- âœ… **No feature limitations** - Full functionality, forever
- âœ… **No usage limits** - Use it commercially, personally, anywhere
- âœ… **No forced upgrades** - Current version will always work
- âœ… **Community first** - Built for developers, by developers

**Premium offerings (Console/Cloud) are separate products** that extend Shimmy's capabilities but never replace or limit the core experience.

## ðŸ“Š Market Position
- **Target Market**: 127M+ developers worldwide running AI workloads
- **Problem**: Cloud AI costs $0.002-0.06/token, vendor lock-in, privacy concerns
- **Solution**: 100% local, 100% private, 100% free, drop-in OpenAI replacement

## Current Milestones
- âœ… Basic server skeleton with OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- âœ… Initial `/v1/chat/completions` support
- âœ… Native Ollama model discovery (`~/.ollama/models/`)
- âœ… Auto port allocation with conflict avoidance
- âœ… GGUF model auto-discovery from HuggingFace cache
- âœ… VS Code extension integration
- âœ… WebSocket streaming support
- âœ… LoRA adapter foundation

## ðŸŽ¯ Q4 2025 Milestones
- [ ] **Enterprise Embeddings** - `/v1/embeddings` endpoint (targeting RAG workloads)
- [ ] **Sub-50ms Startup** - Micro-benchmarking and optimization 
- [ ] **Model Marketplace** - Discovery improvements with popularity rankings
- [ ] **Container-First** - Docker packaging and multi-platform binaries
- [ ] **Enterprise Analytics** - Optional usage metrics and monitoring hooks
- [ ] **10,000 User Milestone** - Community growth and feedback integration

## ðŸš€ 2026 Strategic Initiatives  
- [ ] **Shimmy Console** - Terminal UI frontend with retro aesthetics and advanced controls
- [ ] **Proprietary Integration** - Enhanced inference capabilities via custom Rust toolchain
- [ ] **Developer Experience Suite** - Integrated development environment for AI workflows
- [ ] **Multi-Model Orchestration** - Load balancing across multiple models
- [ ] **Shimmy Cloud** - Enterprise cloud deployment and management platform
- [ ] **Fortune 500 Adoption** - Target enterprise development teams

## ðŸŒŸ Long-Term Vision (2027+)

### Technical Excellence

- **Sub-5MB Binary** - Maintain lightweight footprint (current: 5.1MB)
- **Universal Deployment** - Zero configuration, runs anywhere
- **Hardware Optimization** - SIMD/GPU acceleration within size constraints
- **Enterprise Reliability** - 99.99% uptime, consumer simplicity

### Market Expansion  
- **1M+ Active Developers** - Become the standard for local AI
- **Product Suite Leadership** - Shimmy Console and Cloud ecosystem dominance
- **Enterprise Standard** - Default choice for privacy-conscious organizations
- **Ecosystem Platform** - Hub for local AI development tools
- **Global Infrastructure** - Enable offline AI development worldwide
- **Revenue Diversification** - Free core + premium products (not freemium limitations)

### Industry Impact
- **Privacy Leadership** - Set standards for local-first AI development
- **Cost Reduction** - Save developers billions in cloud AI costs
- **Innovation Catalyst** - Enable new categories of privacy-first AI applications
- **Trust Building** - Demonstrate sustainable open-source without bait-and-switch tactics

## Non-Goals
- UI/dashboard (invisible infrastructure philosophy)
- Model training (inference only)
- Complex configuration (zero-config principle)
- Feature bloat (lightweight focus)
